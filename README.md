Thanks to **SISheogorath** for this project. You can find the sources here:<br>
https://github.com/SISheogorath/readme-to-dockerhub

## Regarding Github Actions & CI configuration

[See README-CI.md](./README-CI.md)

<br>

## Docker hub

Always check on docker hub the most recent build:<br>
[https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/resilio/tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/devmtl/readme-to-dockerhub/tags)

You should use **this tag format** `$VERSION_$DATE_$HASH-COMMIT` in production.

```
devmtl/readme-to-dockerhub:1.0_2019-09-02_10H38s35_ca032df
```

These tags are also available to test stuff quickly:

```
devmtl/readme-to-dockerhub:1.0
devmtl/readme-to-dockerhub:stable
devmtl/readme-to-dockerhub:latest
```

<br>

# How to use it

```
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/README.md:/data/README.md \
  -e DOCKERHUB_USERNAME="devmtl" \
  -e DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD="${DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD}" \
  -e DOCKERHUB_REPO_PREFIX="devmtl" \
  -e DOCKERHUB_REPO_NAME="readme-to-dockerhub" \
  devmtl/readme-to-dockerhub:stable
```


## Environment variables

This image uses environment variables for configuration.

|Available variables     |Default value        |Description                                         |
|------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
|`DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`    |no default           |The Username (not mail address) used to authenticate|
|`DOCKERHUB_PASSWORD`    |no default           |Password of the `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`-user           |
|`DOCKERHUB_REPO_PREFIX` |`$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`|Organisation or username for the repository         |
|`DOCKERHUB_REPO_NAME`   |no default           |Name of the repository you want to push to          |
|`README_PATH`           |`/data/README.md`    |Path to the README.me to push                       |
|`SHORT_DESCRIPTION`     |no default           |Short description for the Dockerhub repo            |

## Mount the README.md

By default, if the `README_PATH` environment variable is not set, this image always pushes the file
`/data/README.md` as full description to Docker Hub.

For GitHub repositories you can use `-v /path/to/repository:/data/`.

If your description is not named `README.md` mount the file directory using `-v /path/to/description.md:/data/README.md`.

*Notice that the filename is case sensitive. If your readme is called `readme.md` you have to mount the file directly, not the directory*
